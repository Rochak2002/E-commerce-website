            <h1>Effect of Technology in Student's Life</h1>
            <h4>By Rochak Lama | 6th April,2022</h4>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Technology has become an everyday aspect of our life during the last two to
              three decades. We are all
              surrounded by technology and have become accustomed to it. The majority of our job is done with
              technology, and we are fully reliant on it. Our lives have been taken over by technology at this point. We
              are surrounded by them as we look around. Computers, cellphones, televisions, and other electronic devices
              that we use on a regular basis are all around us. The way we work, communicate, and engage with one
              another has altered as a result of technological advancements. Furthermore, the rapid spread of
              smartphones is directly linked to the growing rise of e-commerce and internet-based businesses.<br>
              Technology, like anything else, has both positive and harmful aspects. It is not determined by technology.
              It is up to the user to decide how to utilize it, whether to use it positively or negatively. If
              technology is not properly used, it may be extremely detrimental to society and the environment. While the
              smartphone has simplified and revolutionized our job, it has also made us lethargic. Today, you can
              accomplish a lot of things without leaving your house; everything is at your fingertips and can be done
              from the comfort of your own home. As a result, we no longer need to go to palaces to work lying, as we
              did previously.We are so reliant on technology that we end up injuring ourselves by not being fully active
              in our bodies and not engaging in any physical exercise. This is especially true for the younger
              generation, since we have become so reliant on technology and spend so much time utilizing it. They are so
              engrossed in their smartphones that they do not engage in any physical exercise. Smartphone addiction is
              on the rise in today's world, and it's wreaking havoc on our lives.<br>
              Not only are there bad consequences, but there are several favorable consequences as well. Every day, we
              can see how technology is altering our lives. We have been able to do so much in several disciplines
              thanks to the use of technology and its assistance. Technology has aided us in better communication; via
              the use of various technologies, we may speak with individuals who are far away from their homes, as well
              as communicate from one location to another. The usage of a smartphone allows us to contact anybody in a
              matter of minutes or seconds, which is quite beneficial to each of us.Similarly, technology has aided us
              much in the realm of transportation, and there have been several improvements in this area. We can get to
              other palaces as quickly as possible thanks to technology. Different technical developments, such as
              aircraft, trains, and metros, have made it easier for us to get to the palace every day. It has altered
              the way people travel and made things a lot simpler. If we utilize technology correctly, we may greatly
              benefit the environment as well as the many communities and individuals that live there. Education has
              undergone a radical transformation as a result of technological advancements. Teaching and learning have
              been simplified, made more exciting, and made easier to learn.<br>
              Technology can help students become more engaged. Education technology can help students better engage
              with course material by making learning more interactive and collaborative. They learn by doing rather
              than remembering knowledge. This may be as basic as taking an interactive quiz in class or engaging in
              tech-enabled group conversations, or it could be as complex as playing educational games, performing
              science experiments in a virtual lab, or going on a virtual field trip.
              However, in order to be genuinely interesting, it must be participatory. Using a computer to do arithmetic
              is no different than using a pencil and pad of paper. Using augmented reality to illustrate arithmetic
              problems, on the other hand, is a very new ballgame. Interactivity improves the learning experience for
              certain learners.<br>
              Technology may also be used to broaden classroom boundaries; with technology, there are no limits to what
              can be done in the classroom. Anyone from wherever in the globe may learn and get the same amount of
              information. <br>
              Students who struggled to grasp new topics in a regular classroom would soon lag behind their peers.
              Students, on the other hand, may work at their own speed with online assignments. Those who want more time
              or assistance outside of class can do so through guided activities or supplemental coursework. Students
              may access materials online anytime they need them, and teachers can detect which students might need
              extra support, thanks to technology's always-on nature. Self-paced learning also aids students in
              developing digital literacy and 21st-century abilities, which will come in handy once they enter the
              profession.<br>
              There are both positive and bad elements to this, as with all things; it simply depends on who is using it
              and what he or she is using it for. It has the potential to damage us if not utilized properly, but when
              used correctly, it has the potential to benefit us in a variety of ways. While technology may be viewed as
              a danger, it does have its limitations, using it into your teaching practice allows students to interact
              and connect with course material in new ways. Education is no longer limited to the four walls of your
              classroom, thanks to technological advancements. YouTube videos and social media don't have to be a source
              of distraction;  they may actually be used to supplement your course material. It's simple math: greater
              learning results add up.
